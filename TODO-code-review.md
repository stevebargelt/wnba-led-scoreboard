- [x] Guard against `None` favorite identifiers before lowercasing in the aggregator (`app.py:96` can append a `None` abbr and `_is_favorite_game` at `src/sports/aggregator.py:204` blindly does `fav.lower()`, which crashes whenever a favorite is missing an abbreviation/id).
- [ ] Wire up the advertised priority rules (`src/sports/aggregator.py:33` exposes `playoff_boost` and `conflict_resolution`, but `get_featured_game`/`_calculate_game_priorities` never read them, so `MANUAL`/`LIVE_FIRST` modes and playoff boosts from config are silently ignored).
- [x] Use the signed-in user token when invoking the device action function (`web-admin/src/pages/device/[id].tsx:263-274` currently sends the anon key in the `Authorization` header, so the Supabase edge function sees an unauthenticated call and either fails with 401 or runs without user context).
