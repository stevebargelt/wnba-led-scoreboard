1. Favorite Team Priority Rules
- [ ] Wire up the advertised priority rules (`src/sports/aggregator.py:33` exposes `playoff_boost` and `conflict_resolution`, but `get_featured_game`/`_calculate_game_priorities` never read them, so `MANUAL`/`LIVE_FIRST` modes and playoff boosts from config are silently ignored). the aggregator still doesn't use the playoff_boost and conflict_resolution settings exposed at line 33. Consider either:
Implementing these features in _calculate_game_priorities()
Removing the unused configuration options to avoid confusion

2. Test coverage gaps:
- [ ]  The test file test_multi_sport_config.py only covers basic config loading scenarios
- [ ] Missing tests for the new null-safety logic in the aggregator
- [ ] No tests for edge cases with missing team identifiers
Consider adding tests for the authentication flow changes

3. Type safety could be improved
- [ ] The _normalize() function in aggregator could benefit from proper type hints
- [ ] Consider using Optional[str] consistently throughout the codebase

4. Silent configuration failures
- [ ] The aggregator will now silently skip None identifiers. Consider logging a warning when a favorite team has incomplete data to help users debug configuration issues.

5. Edge function authentication context
- [ ] While the web admin now sends the user token, verify that the edge function (on-action/index.ts) doesn't need modifications to properly validate authenticated requests vs anonymous ones.

6. Suggestions
- [ ] Add configuration validation: Consider adding a validation step that warns users about teams missing abbreviations or IDs

7. Consider making the demo pregame countdown configurable via environment variable for different testing scenarios.

8. Add logging for demo mode transitions and rotations to aid debugging.

9. Document the threading model explicitly if the simulator will be accessed from multiple threads.

10. Consider extracting sport-specific constants (period lengths, scoring patterns) to a configuration file for easier tuning.

11. Package.json Script Complexity
The pretest:ci script has become complex with conditional musl detection. Consider extracting this to a separate shell script for better maintainability.

12. Test Data Duplication
There is significant duplication of test data across files (team objects, mock responses). Consider extracting common test fixtures to a shared test utils file for reusability.

13. Timer Management
The use of jest.useFakeTimers() and jest.runOnlyPendingTimers() could be more robust. Consider using waitFor with specific assertions instead of manual timer advancement.
